<B>Player Status -</B> This player status provides all the information about the status of the
characters.  To make things easier, we'll discuss each side at a time.

The left side of the player status frame shows your characters energy, strength and speed
stats.  The percent of each compared to the maximum is displayed with a color bar, starting
at green when at 100% and slowing turning to red at 20%.  The actual number is displayed in the
center of the bar.
   </P>
   
   <P>
To the left of each bar is equipment that modifies the stat: shield, sword and quicksilver.  This
equipment's adjustment is already incorporated into the bar.  Each plus with this equipment adds
directly to the character's stat.

The top of the right side provides character location information.  Included is the character name, the
name of the location and the coordinates of the character's present location.

Below this are pictures and values describing a character's more important stats.  Here's a quick
rundown of what the pictures mean.

The action buttons are used for most of the decisions in Phantasia, so you'll be pushing them a lot.
To make things easier, the numbers 1-8 on your keyboard can be used in place of are aliases for any of these buttons as long as the cursor
is not in the input field in the chat area.  The function keys will do the same thing and will work
in the chat input field.  You can also use the space bar to hit the left-most active button.  These keyboard shortcuts are un-available in the 1.02 Java client.
   </P>
   
   <P>
The list of players on the right will tell you who is currently playing and give some basic
information about them.  A letter is used to designate the character race and a second may be
used for characters that have attained special ranks.  Race designations are M, F, E, D, H and X
for Magic-User, Fighter, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling and Experimento.  Rank designations are N, S, K, Q, C, V, X and
W for kNight, Steward, King, Queen, Council of the Wise, Valar, Ex-Valar and Game Wizard. 
   </P>

   <P>
The number to the right of these designations indicate the channel a character 
is in.  Players can only hear and speak to other players who are in the same 
channel.  Players start on channel 1, the newbie channel, but have the option 
to change this under the "Info" menu available while playing.  Profanity is 
not permitted on channel 1 and speaking privileges may be taken away if this
is abused.
