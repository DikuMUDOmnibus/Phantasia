   <P>
There are many things in the Phantasia world that a <A HREF="characters.html">character</A> may bring along with him/her.  This
equipment could be bought at a <A HREF="realm.html#post">trading post</A> or won through <A HREF="combat.html">combat</A>.  Some directly affect your
<A HREF="stats.html">attributes</A> and others give you special abilities.
   </P>

   <P>
   <A NAME="shield"><B>Shield</B></A>
 - A shield directly increases a characters maximum <A HREF="stats.html#energy">energy</A> by the strength of the shield.  For
example, if a character with 10 <A HREF="stats.html#energy">energy</A> points and no shield picks up a 5 point shield, then the
character's maximum <A HREF="stats.html#energy">energy</A> is now 15.  Shields will degrade over time and can not be combined
to form a more powerful shield.
   </P>

   <P>
   <A NAME="sword"><B>Sword</B></A>
 - When a player enters <A HREF="combat.html">combat</A>, sword is added to <A HREF="stats.html#strength">strength</A> to determine damage for <A HREF="combat.html#melee">melee attacks</A>
and <A HREF="combat.html#skirmish">skirmish attacks</A> and the sword value is added directly to <A HREF="combat.html#nick">nick attack</A> damage.  Swords, like
<A HREF="equipment.html#shield">shields</A>, can not be combined and will degrade.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Quicksilver</B>
 - A player's <A HREF="stats.html#quickness">quickness</A> is increased by the square root of his/her quicksilver. Like <A HREF="equipment.html#sword">swords</A> and <A HREF="equipment.html#shield">shields</A>,
quicksilver degrades and can not be combined.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Mana</B>
 - Mana is the currency of spells.  You will need to use some mana to cast just about anything.  Some spells have a fixed cost while others allow you to specify how much mana to use.  See the <A HREF="spells.html">spells</A> for more information.
   </P>

   <P>
   <A NAME="gold"><B>Gold</B></A>
 - A player's gold can only be spent purchasing items at a <A HREF="realm.html#post">trading post</A>.  
If a player collects too much gold, it will begin to slow him/her down.  
Although it varies between character classes, the average character may carry 
1000 plus 175 per <A HREF="stats.html#level">level</A> gold without speed 
penalties.  Any gold collected in the <A HREF="realm.html">realm</A> will 
be <A HREF="king.html#tax">taxed</A>.
   </P>

   <P>
   <A NAME="gems"><B>Gems</B></A>
 - Gems can be found on the more powerful <A HREF="monsters.html">monsters</A> in the outer <A HREF="realm.html#circle">circles</A> of the game.  Each gem is worth
1000 <A HREF="equipment.html#gold">gold</A> and weigh only half as much as one coin.  Gems are also subject to the king's <A HREF="king.html#tax">tax</A>.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Blessing</B>
 - Blessings are powerful items that give you first attack in combat.  If two 
blessed characters encounter each other, the blessings cancel, and quickness 
is used to determin initiative.  Blessings can be purchased at some of the 
distant posts or won from the strongest monsters.
   </P>

<P><B>Staff</B> - Staves are found on the stronger monsters, and with it a
player can become steward at The Lord's Chamber. This can not be done if a
king or queen reigns. Staves are lost when used and cashed in at level 200.</P>

   <P>
   <B>Crowns</B>
 - With a crown, gained only by destroying the One Ring, a character can 
enter The Lord's Chamber and become king or queen.  The crown is lost when 
this is done and combat will ensue if another king or queen is already at 0,0.  
Crowns are cashed in for gold when the player reaches level 2000.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Palantir</B>
 - A palantir is required for a council member to search for and find the holy grail, but it will also locate corpses. All players who possess one can see 
the coordinates of players who are outside your circle and/or cloaked.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Virgin</B>
 - A virgin is the only way to subdue a Unicorn.  If successful, you will 
gain experience and treasure as if you had killed it.  Beware, unicorns are
also fairly picky about the morals of the player, too.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Ring</B>
 - Rings are only carried by <A HREF="monsters.html#nazgul">nazguls</A> and <A HREF="monsters.html#lord">The Dark Lord</A>. When used, all rings rest the player to maximum <A HREF="stats.html#energy">energy</A>, and
cause him/her to hit much harder in <A HREF="combat.html">battle</A>.  Some rings are
permament, some rings will disappear after a number of uses and some will 
slowly consume the wearer, turning them into a ring wraith to attack 
future adventurers.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Holy Water</B>
 - These vials can kill faeries, seven of the game's monsters.  When you have enough, they will be automatically used.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Amulets</B>
 - Amulets protect the user from cursed treasure and are destroyed in 
the process.  They are used automatically.  More powerful curses will consume
more amulets.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>Charms</B>
 - These do the exact same thing as amulets, but can also be used in 
conjunction with a blessing to overthrow the Dark Lord.  If a character has 
enough amulet and a charm, the amulets will be used first to protect the player.
   </P>
