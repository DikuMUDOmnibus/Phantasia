   <P>
When two players occupy the same coordinates, they may engage in battle. The 
player who moved onto the other will first need to confirm the move. If there 
is no confirmation or the other player moves, no battle occurs.
The defender always gets first strike, irregardless of blessing.
   </P>
   
   <P>
A player has the same options in inter-terminal combat as he/she does in 
normal combat, but many of them are modified.  All or nothing has a straight
5% chance of success.  Other spells will have a greater chance of failure, 
luckout is not as effective and nick does not transfer all the experience lost 
or work at all against council members.  Also, the transform spell may 
backfire when used in inter-terminal combat.
   </P>

   <P>
Upon slaying a player in battle the winner gets a fraction of his opponent's experience and may get to loot the new corpse.  The loser is dead.
