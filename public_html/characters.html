   <P>
Phantasia characters have only one chance in life.  Although your
character is saved in a common file when you leave the game via
the <A HREF="interface.html#quit">quit button</A>, it is removed when restored 
with the proper password, and can not be re-restored if the character dies.  
In addition, the save file is frequently purged of inactive characters.
   </P>
   
   <P>
When the client and the server disconnect, the game saves your characters as
soon as possible. If you are in combat, your character will leave when you get
a chance to attack and a fresh monster will be summoned upon return. If you
return to find your character gone, then you had no chances to attack.  In a
battle with another player, the game will try to evade until you are free of the
battle or dead.</P>
   
   <P>
All phantasia characters have a distinctive class.  In
addition to <A HREF="stats.html">attributes</A>, this character class also determines how
much <A HREF="treasure.html#gold">gold</A> a player may carry, how long until <A HREF="treasure.html#ring">rings</A> can overcome
the player, and how much mana the character can have.  The
current classes are:
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>magic user</B>
- strong in <A HREF="stats.html" NAME="magic">magic level</A> and <A HREF="stats.html#brains">brains</A>, weak in other areas.  Must rely
on wits and <A HREF="spells.html">magic</A> to survive.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>fighter</B>
- good in <A HREF="stats.html#strength">strength</A> and <A HREF="stats.html#quickness">speed</A>.  This adds up to a character well-equipped to fight but poor in magic and brains.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>elf</B>
- very high <A HREF="stats.html#quickness">quickness</A> and above average <A HREF="stats.html#magic">magic level</A> are elves selling points.  Although weak in energy, elves are immune to the plague.</P>

   <P>
   <B>dwarf</B>
-  very high <A HREF="stats.html#energy">energy level</A> and <A HREF="stats.html#strength">strength</A>, but with a tendency to be
extremely slow and not too bright.  The tank of characters, 
dwarves regenerate energy at a slightly faster rate than any other class. 
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>halfling</B>
- very <A HREF="stats.html#brains">smart</A> backed up with good combat abilities, but poor in <A HREF="stats.html#magic">magic</A>.  
The halfling excels through the use of luckout and tends to lead a charmed 
life when it comes to deflecting special attacks.  Born with some 
<A HREF="stats.html#experience">experience</A>.
   </P>

   <P>
   <B>experimento</B>
- mediocre in all areas.  However, the experimento may begin the game 
placed almost anywhere within 2000 distance of the origin and uses the
fewest charms to block special attacks.
   </P>

   <P>
Each character class starts off with base statistics.  These
attributes are rolled randomly from the following list:

Not only are the starting characteristics different for the
various character types, the characteristics progress at
different rates for each class type as the character goes
up in level.  An experimento's characteristics progress randomly
as one of the other class types. The progression as characters increase
in level is summarized in the following table.
