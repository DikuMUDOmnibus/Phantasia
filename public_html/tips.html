   <P>
Rule #1 : The Game Wizards are always right.
   </P>

   <P>
The game will timeout waiting for input which gets faster as a player goes
up in levels.  This is to try to keep the game a bit faster paced.
   </P>

   <P>
The corpse of a council member or valar has never been found.
   </P>

   <P>
A guru will never be disgusted with your sins if they are less than one.
   </P>

   <P>
Teleports are more efficient over shorter distances.
   </P>

   <P>
A medic wants approximately half of a player's gold to cure 1 poison, 
more to cure blindness.  Never offer a medic what you don't have.
   </P>

   <P>
There is a maximum amount of mana a player may possess, based upon level.
   </P>

   <P>
Buying books will increase brains and thus increase the effectiveness of 
luckout.  No matter how they are bought, each book is less effective 
than the last.
   </P>

   <P>
Characters are automatically retired when they get close to level 10000.
   </P>

   <P>
Curses, plagues and monster attacks inflict more poison in outer circles.
   </P>

   <P>
Blindness goes away in time.
   </P>

   <P>
Beware of merchants.  They are a greedy lot.
   </P>

   <P>
If you're being harassed by a bully, consider using all-or-nothing.  The
spell is an equalizer to prevent high-level characters from picking on
low-level ones.  It is much more effective against sinful characters
than non-sinful ones.
   </P>


   <P>
Do not meddle in the affairs of Game Wizards, for they are subtle and 
quick to anger.  In particular, do not ask the Game Wizards for help unless
the game is at fault, not you.
   </P>

   <P>
Do not bother the apprentices for help with the game, for they do not
have the capability to do so.  They are only able to punish and moderate.
   </P>

   <P>
Good luck and have fun!  Press "The Game" below to start a game.
