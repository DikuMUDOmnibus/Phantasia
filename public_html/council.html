<P>A player automatically becomes a member of the Council of the Wise upon
reaching level 3000.  The main purpose in life for members of the Council is
to seek the Holy Grail, although messing with the other players is also fun.
Upon finding the grail, the player ascends to the position of valar if the
player has infinitesimally small sin. Otherwise, it's all over.</P>

<P>The Holy Grail does little for non-Council members. Whenever anyone finds
it, it moves, but it is always located within 1e+6 in any compass direction of
the origin.</P>

<P>All Council of the Wise have intervene options that cost a percentage of
their mana.  These options are: </P>

<P><H5>Slap</H5> - Slapped players are knocked off their coordinates, off the
chat channel and sometimes off the game.</P>

<P><H5>Blind</H5> - Blinds another player.</P>

<P><H5>Heal</H5> - Heals another player. This is just a quick way for that
player to be rested.</P>

<P><H5>Seek Grail</H5> - This will reveal the approximate distance to 
the Holy Grail.  A palantir is required to cast this spell, but it is much 
less accurate for ex-valars.</P>

<P><H5>Seek Corpse</H5> - Allows the player to seek a corpse nearby to pillage
for treasure. A palantir is required to cast this spell.</P>
